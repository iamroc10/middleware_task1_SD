# middleware_task1_SD
The goal is to design and implement a cluster manager capable of executing parallel computing jobs in a number of worker nodes. 
We used the standard middleware services xmlrpc and Redis.

In the main folder there are two Python files that includes the code of the Client and the Server. We also have two more files that are the test programs to prove it.

To execute it we have to execute the code of the Server (server_xmlrpc.py) and, then, execute the Client (client_xmlrpc.py). After this, in the Client's windows will appear a menu to choose which function of all you want to run.
